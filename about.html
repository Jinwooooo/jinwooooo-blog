		Hello! I'm just a dude creating posts about my doodles. I'm mostly interested in Data Analysis (overall Data Science) and
		I also play this mobile game called 'Browndust', which is a SRPG developed in ROK. I'm thinking about making some things related
		it, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Also I'm currently in my final year project in my university, so will post about
		stuffs related to it. If you are looking for specific posts, I suggest using the classifying tools available in my blog :^)
