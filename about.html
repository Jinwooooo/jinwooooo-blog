		Hello! I'm just a dude creating posts about my doodles. I'm mostly interested in Data related stuff
		(overall Data Analysis/Science) and I also love this mobile game called 'Brown Dust', which is a SRPG developed in ROK.
		If the Data Analysis/Science stuff was started in Kaggle.com, I will make a Kernel there and make a post about the abstract
		and a link. Otherwise, all the codes and the good stuff will be uploaded as a post. For Brown Dust, I will make post
		ranging from basic ~ advanced topics.
	</br></br>
		I'm also currently in my final year project in my university, so if I find anything interesting along the process, I will
		post about those as well.
