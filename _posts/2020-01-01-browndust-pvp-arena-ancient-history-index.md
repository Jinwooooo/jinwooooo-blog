This category will rewind the clock back to the beginning of Browndust and elaborate on the big meta/concept that have shaped the PvP Arena. It will be based on KR Server. The timeline is basically from 2017 April to early 2018 February (Browndust's first abroad server launch was on 2018 April).

This category will only cover what I felt had big impact within the game. There were small meta(s) here and there.

Because it was long ago there were systems that did not exist in the past. The biggest 5 systems were

* Ancient Coin System
* Soul Gear System
* Dominus Octo
* Companion System
* Custom / Pity System

I will specifically inform in each post if these systems existed or not :).
