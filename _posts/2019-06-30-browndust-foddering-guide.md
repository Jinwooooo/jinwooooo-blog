## Abstract

In Browndust, there's 3 ways to do foddering.

1. Campaign
2. Mystic Island
3. Slimes

For beginners **Campaign** is the best way to accelerate growth, but as you become more experienced, it might become unnecessary. At that point it is recommended to use **Mystic Island** and leftover **Slimes**. This post is on **Campaign**.

Note that the numbers for analysis are based on data by KR users in KR Browndust Official Community. Basically, it's not a formal analysis.
