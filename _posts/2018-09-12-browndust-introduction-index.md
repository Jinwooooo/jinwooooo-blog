I play this mobile game called Brown Dust, a SRPG (Strategic Role Playing Game). Currently there are 3 servers : Korea, Japan, and SEA. I play in the Korea server which is few patches ahead of the other regions. I will be making posts related strategies, unit reviews, formations, and etc.

If you are interested in my regular arena placements here are the particulars
