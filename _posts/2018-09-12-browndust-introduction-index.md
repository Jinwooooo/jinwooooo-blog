<img src="../uploads/browndust-introduction-main.jpg">

I play this mobile game called Browndust, a SRPG (Strategic Role Playing Game). Currently there are 6 servers : Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Asia, Europe and Global. I play in the Korea & Asia server. For most of Browndust related post, I will be referring to Korea which is few patches ahead of other regions. I will be making posts related strategies, unit reviews, formations, and etc. However, I generally do not enjoy making posts that are ephemeral (i.e. tier list).

If you are interested in my regular arena placements here are the particulars

**KR Server Deck Type** Granhildr Support Variation Formation (Used to use 2 Row Formation Variation, but switched to Granhildr deck on July 2018)

**KR Server 2018 ~ 2019**

* 2018 August : Master I ~ Master III
* 2018 September : Master II ~ Grandmaster III
* 2018 October : Master III ~ Grandmaster III
* 2018 November : Master I ~ Grandmaster II
* 2018 December : Master I ~ Grandmaster III
* 2019 January : Master III ~ Master I
* 2019 February and Onwards : Hoarding AC related resources (i.e. no longer competitive)

I don't even burn natural swords regularly now on KR. I usually end up in Sapphire. High chance I'm going to let my KR account go due to the fact that my previously invested AC units are completely outclassed by Dominus Octos.

**Asia Server Deck Type** 2 Row Power Variations (I switch up accordingly)

**Asia Server 2019**

* 2019 May : Grandmaster II ~ Grandmaster I
