<img src="../uploads/browndust-introduction-main.jpg">

I play this mobile game called Browndust, a SRPG (Strategic Role Playing Game). Currently there are 6 servers : Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Asia, Europe and Global. I play in the Korea & Asia server. For most of Browndust related post, I will be referring to Korea which is few patches ahead of other regions. I will be making posts related strategies, unit reviews, formations, and etc. However, I generally do not enjoy making posts that are ephemeral (e.g. tier list).

If you are interested in my regular arena placements here are the particulars

**KR Server Deck Type** Granhildr Support Variation Formation (Used to use 2 Row Formation Variation, but switched to Granhildr deck on July 2018)

**KR Server 2018 ~ 2019**

**IGN** Baloo (no longer active)

* 2018 : Master III ~ Grandmaster I
* 2019 January ~ June : Sapphire III ~ Master I

I'm no longer active in KR.

**Asia Server Deck Type** 2 ~ 3 Row Power Variations (I switch up accordingly)

**Asia Server 2019 ~ Onwards**

**IGN** Baroo

* 2019 : Ruby III ~ Champion
