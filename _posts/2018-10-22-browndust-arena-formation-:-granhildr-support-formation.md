This post isn't for players who just started playing Brown Dust. You need to have some experience in Brown Dust Arena contents. I will not go in length to explain unit skills and mechanics.

## Abstract

GSF (Granhildr Support Formation) has been able to stay in meta from almost beginning of Brown Dust and is still one of the most popular and powerful formation currently. GSF can be said to be efficient because it is able to adapt to different meta. (note that GSF also requires to adjust to the meta by tweaking formation and substituting units)

Due to dependency of meta, I will not be able to give out solid examples and formations like the other formations I have posted about (in KR official cafe, I posted about GSF a month ago and is already starting to become outdated). I am going to introduce key units in GSF and talk about the theory behind how GSF works.

## Key Units (Static / Fixed)

The most primary units that are focused in GSF are the **Traitorous Trinity** set, Granhildr + Refithea + Celia.

It's very important to note that the unit who gets the spotlight changes depending on the meta. For example, when there weren't many units that could efficiently kill Granhildr, the spotlight naturally went to Granhildr (what I mean by "efficiently kill" means that the unit is able to perform decently when it goes against other formtions). But, when meta shifted and Granhildr started dying in the 1st round, the spotlight went to Celia.

Let's look at each unit's skills more carefully.

**Granhildr**

<img src="../uploads/browndust-granhildr-support-formation-granhildr-skill.jpg">

* **+0 ~ +2** Improvement in Barrier. It's not bad, but there's a upper bound for barriers, so it's not much of an improvement
* **+3 ~ +5** Now has reflect damage on Debuff Reflection. The numbers aren't so high, so I wouldn't expect too much from here either
* <span style="color:blue">**+6 ~ +8** This is the pinnacle of Granhildr. With set hp buff and decent % hp runes, she will hit like a truck if you give enough buffs on her. This is the moment where Granhildr is able to become a dps tank (like fighter/brawler type) instead of just taunt tank with ok reflection.</span>
* **+9 ~ +10** I wouldn't recommend investing AC here. In terms of functionality, nothing changes.

**Refithea**

<img src="../uploads/browndust-granhildr-support-formation-refithea-skill.jpg">

* **+0 ~ +2** Improvement in Damage Reflect. It's quite good for Granhildr because she lacks damage reflect.
* **+3 ~ +5** Improvement in Crit Rate. Reflect can crit, so pretty much improving damage reflect.
* <span style="color:green">**+6 ~ +8** This is where Refithea becomes really good. Her Glutty Bestowal now as a similar effect to Masochism where the unit under Glutty effect heal when they are hit. (Note that unlike Masochism, they heal AFTER the auto attack). Moreover, the heal can crit, so her Improvement in Crit Rate actually now has more value than previously.</span>
* **+9** Increase the buff by 2 turns. This is quite good for GSF because of the number of supports that are used with GSF, they eat up a lot of turns and this gives more flexibility.
* <span style="color:blue">**+10** This is when Refithea becomes the God of supports. She gives huge dps, survivability, and utility.</span>

**Celia**

There isn't much to talk about Celia actually. She's either a figure just to buff Granhildr's HP or a gigaton nuker.

<img src="../uploads/browndust-granhildr-support-formation-celia-skill.jpg">

* **+0 ~ +2** Improvement in Curse. More effective as debuffer than dps at this stage.
* **+3 ~ +10** From +3 and onwards, give her 3 or more dps enhancement buffs from supports and congratulations! You now have a gigaton nuker.

### What to focus / invest?

I'd suggest investing into +10 Refithea first. A +10 Refithea can be used anywhere (even in power formations). Very safe investment. After +10 Refithea you need to look at the current meta and your tier. The flow logic is quite simple at this point.

<img src="../uploads/browndust-granhildr-support-formation-flowchart-investment.jpg">

<span style="color:blue">Say the answer was no and AC was invested into Granhildr.</span> The moment you hit +6 on Granhildr you will want to give around 3 offensive and defensive buff <span style="color:red">(MUST have at least 1 Healing Support)</span> to Granhildr and refresh the buff with Elijah. I call this strategy **Granhildr Shredder**.

Basically what happens is that Granhildr with Titan's Strike, you have a chance of killing 1~2 units (any unit that has weak defensive ability will die). After that because enemy can't kill Granhildr with reflect + glutty on, so enemy dps unit will die from attacking Granhildr, but leaving perhaps a bit of scratch on Granhildr.

Just an example what **Granhildr Shredder** would look like (it doesn't have to be exactly like this, there are many ways you can make this work).

<img src="../uploads/browndust-granhildr-support-formation-granhildr-shredder-example.jpg">

<span style="color:blue">Now consider that the answer was yes and AC was invested into Celia.</span> What you want to do is try to let Granhildr do her thing simliar to **Granhildr Shredder**, but since we know that she's likely to die, you leave the next unit that goes after Granhildr to Celia. What this means is that the buff that went to Granhildr is now going to be on Celia on Round 2 if Granhildr wasn't able to make it.

You have to consider a case where Granhildr dies on the first turn (e.g. enemy's first turn was buffed +10 Edin), this means you need to make sure Celia and main dps supports are unhindered until round 2. This means you will need additional taunt units to ensure Celia and dps supports safety. The safe number is 3, but 2 usually works as well.

If you noticed, the example I have shown previously kind of uses the theory I have just elaborated on. You can see that Veronia's dps buff goes on to Celia if Granhildr was taken out on Round 1.

### What formations / stratgies do I use while I invest in my Traitorous Trinity?

This is the part I can't help you out very well, this is very specific to the user's available unit and meta. However, I will try to make a small list of strategies you could use.

**All Traitorous Trinity Skill Level Lower than 3**

* **Pushing Turn Strategy** First start with a taunt that is not Granhildr (can be anything, John+Celia, Zakan, Seir, etc). Enemy units will likely have distributed all of their buffs on their first turn. Next you use up 3~4 turns before activating Granhildr. Usually most other formations use 3 or more offensive unit, it's highly likely the 3rd and after unit that attacks will have no offensive buff so that it has minimal threat to Granhildr.

* **Mage Holocaust Strategy** For this strategy, Granhildr is just used as a taunt tank pretty much. If she is likely to die in 1 hit, you have to use 3 taunts. If Granhildr is able to take more hits than 1, 2 taunt may work (depends on who the other taunt unit is). Other than these 2~3 taunts, other 3 units should be either 3 mage or 2 mage + 1 offensive unit. All you are hoping is for the round to go to 2 so that all your mages can unleash hell. If possible you should try to incorporate Pushing Turn Strategy here (1st taunt → support → support → mage → support/taunt → ...)

* **Granhildr Dynasty** This requires a really good healer, so if there isn't any good healers available, this strategy is a bust. Basically, you want to attack with offensive units first to get rid of threats and then activate Granhildr at the last turn when they are weak. If you manage to kill most of the enemy's support or offensive units, this strategy has a high winrate. However, there are many scenarios where Granhildr or the healer dies before they get the chance to activate, so this strategy is very hard to use.

### Are there other variations?

YES! There are very unique variations out there. Many GSF users have their own twist. Some like to use multiple mages to have distributed damage after surviving the 1st round with multiple taunts, some use multiple high singular dps units to take out key units in the 1st round, there are even users with multiple reflector units for maximum shredding. I believe this part is completely up to you! :^)

What I have discussed earlier on what to invest is probably the most safest way to gain points in arena (in terms of AC investment).

## Key Units (Dynamic / Substitutable)

<img src="../uploads/browndust-granhildr-support-formation-dynamic-support.jpg">

I think these units are substitutable depending on the current meta. **Elijah especially**. <span style="color:blue">Recently Mary has been replaced quite heavily by Benaca in KR Server</span>, so I suppose Mary isn't as good as the other two.

### What about Offensive Units and other Support Units?

<span style="color:red">They are like interchangeable parts in GSF</span>. Think of Granhildr, Refithea, and Celia are engine of a car. Other units are tires, body parts, suspension, etc. For example, Floria was a key part of GSF from June ~ August in KR Server, but now it's very hard to see GSF with Floria. That defensive support role is now taken by Themis. There is no point of giving recommendation of these interchangeable units because within few months they are highly likely to be obsolete.

Sorry if you were looking for a list of units which are good for GSF. I just don't see the point of taking time to make them and see them become completely outdated before 2019.

## Final Thoughts

I'd really like to bring out solid examples to explain about how GSF works, but seriously the GSF post I've made in KR about a month ago is already on the verge of being obsolete. Even the AC investment is subject to change depending on the new octos that will be released in 8 November, 2018. (there also have been 1 update for buffing 6 devils, so I suppose it could happen again soon after octos are out)

Perhaps I'll make a post later about high ranking GSF history, which might help you understand more about GSF '^'.
