This post isn't for players who just started playing Brown Dust. The audience it's targeting is users who have some experience in Brown Dust Arena contents. I will not go in length to explain unit skills and mechanics.

### Chapter 1 : Defensive / Offensive Row

The 2 Row Variation Formation will only be using 2 rows out of 3. One of the row is Defensive row (aka Dummy row) and the other row is Offensive Row.

**Defensive Row**

You can think of this row's purpose as a sandbag. It's supposed to take heavy fire from the enemy's units. The beefier the sandbag, the more time/turn it allows ally's offensive unit to deal damage to enemy's units and formation.

***Based on September 2018 (KR Server)***
The most popular units used for Defensive row are as follows:

1. Lucius : He's one of the most imbalanced units right now. The best sandbag in the game.
2. Arkan : He was the most imbalanced unit like Lucius previously, but with one hit with the nerfbat and change of meta, he's currently just a very good sandbag.
3. Lilian : A Mage who's capable of reaching 100% armor. As long as they don't have a fixed damage (armor piercing attacks), she's one of the best walls. She also deals pretty good damage if she gets hit multiple times.
4. Aron : He's very good in PvP (so basically arena), but not so good elsewhere. He is the currently the best reliable taunt damage reflector in the game.
5. Seir : She's like the goddess of PvE. She's also good in certain situation, but those situations are very rare. she's used because of her reliable taunt mostly and if lucky can tank more than 1 turn.
6. Caylen : She's the most recently released taunt fixed (armor piercing) damage reflector unit with some debuff. I haven't seen her much to actually get a grasp on her functionality, but she seems to be gaining popularity.

**Offensive Row**

You typically use the most heavily invested offensive unit in this row. Most of the time the offensive units are placed in the middle and supports and extra defensive units are located at the front or the back (the placement in the Offensive row heavily depends on the current meta). Because there are many offensive units, I will not be showing a example list. However, I do believe elaborating on support is important.

Usually 2 Row Variation Formation lacks durability compared to other formations. As most players know, offensive units without support are not very good. Since 2 Row Variation Formation does not like a elongated fights, it puts a lot of importance on support units. I'd probably even say that you need at least 2 of the top tier supports with this formation (the choice of top tier supports vary depending on your offensive units).

***Based on September 2018 (KR Server)***
The most popular support units used are as follows:

<img src="../uploads/browndust-2-row-formation-support-unit-example.jpg">

1. Repithea : Best support unit at the moment.
2. Benaca : The only downside is that she doesn't have Critical Rate buff. Otherwise she's also as good as Repithea
3. Mary : If a unit has either immune to harmful effect or immune to stat reducing effect, she's very good. Her defensive skill is pretty bad as well.
4. Veronica : She's a single buffer but she has everything a offenisve unit needs : Attack Up, Critical Rate Up, Critical Damage Up, Immunity to Harmful Effect. She's also very tanky, so she can be placed in some position where other support unit should not be placed
5. Michaela : Her popularity is diminishing since the current meta is more about Crit Rate + Crit Damage. However, she's the only support unit that ensures '흉격' (dunno the term for english lol).
6. Ceres : Her support range is very good for 2 row variation formation. She also gives immunity to stat reducing effect which is very important in the current meta. While other support units are ★5, she is ★4, so she's more accessible as well.

***so what combo is good?***

If you are based in Crit Rate + Crit Damage:
* Benaca + Mary
* Benaca + Ceres
* Mary + Ceres

If you are mixed :
* Repithea + Ceres
* Repithea + Benaca
+ Repithea + Mary

If you are based on Att Damage :
* Repithea + Michaela
* Mary + Michaela
* Michaela + Ceres

If you first unit that launches attack has very good AOE:
* Repithea / Mary + Benaca / Micahela + Veronica
